# Image Jigsaw Puzzle Solver - TAMU Datathon 2022

See [E-SSL](https://github.com/rdangovs/essl/tree/main/imagenet/simclr) for all training scripts. The backbone model (resnet50) was pre-trained for 20 epochs with a lambda coefficient of 0.7 (weight of the rotation prediction loss). The backbone weights were then frozen, and the penultimate ffn was fine-tuned for another 80 epochs on the jigsaw puzzle dataset.

## Training Stats

### Pre-training task
{"epoch": 18, "step": 14670, "learning_rate": 0.15161152976772346, "loss": 2.669699192047119, "acc": 0.734375, "time": 1289}

### Jigsaw solving task (fine-tuning linear classifier)
{"epoch": 19, "acc1": 65.85144927536231, "acc5": 95.51127214170693, "best_acc1": 65.85144927536231, "best_acc5": 95.51127214170693}

Note that epochs were not recorded correctly for the jigsaw solving task, so '19' is not correct. 'acc@n' refers to accuracy on a validation set.
